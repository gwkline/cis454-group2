Willow Project Manager

CIS 454 - Group 2

Liam Hannah, Gavin Kline, Steven Liu, Kevin Sullivan




Introduction
While learning the Agile development process, our group realized there were few elegant and simple project management tools free to use by the general public. With this in mind, we created Willow, an easy to use React web application allowing users to collaborate on projects, as well as their own personal work. Willow features an easy to use interface, a beautiful design scheme, and functionality to fit a number of use cases. Task tracking and assignment, messages, and real time cloud synchronization are some of our major features.
